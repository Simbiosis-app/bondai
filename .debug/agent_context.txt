It can slow aging, mitigate age-related diseases, extend lifespan, and increase health span. The drug is considered safe and has a good safety profile, with generally mild side effects such as gastrointestinal upset and vitamin B-12 deficiency. However, Metformin is not currently approved as an anti-aging treatment, and it is recommended to consult with a healthcare provider about the risks and potential benefits before considering its use for longevity.\n\nSource: [How metformin can slow aging and extend life span | Fortune Well](https://fortune.com/well/2023/05/04/metformin-anti-aging-longevity-risks-side-effects/)\n\n```\n\nappend:\n```\nTrue\n```\n\nthought:\n```\nI am appending the information gathered from the fourth source to the metformin.md file.

The recommendation for a 43-year-old male, in good health and who regularly exercises, is that the use of Metformin for anti-aging may not be necessary at this time. Regular exercise and maintaining good health are already key factors in promoting longevity and preventing age-related diseases. The potential benefits of Metformin for anti-aging, while promising, are still being researched, and the drug is not currently approved for this use. It would be advisable for the individual to consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the potential risks and benefits before considering the use of Metformin for anti-aging. The document also highlights potential risks and tradeoffs from taking the medication."

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember.

However, the mechanisms by which Metformin exerts these effects are still largely unknown, and not all individuals derive the same benefit from the drug. \n\nFor a healthy 43-year-old male who regularly exercises, the benefits of Metformin as an anti-aging therapy are not clear. While Metformin may potentially slow aging and prevent age-related diseases, these benefits are not guaranteed and more research is needed to fully understand the potential of Metformin as an anti-aging therapy. \n\nMoreover, Metformin has several side effects, including gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Other less common side effects can include vitamin B12 deficiency and low blood sugar. Serious side effects are rare but can include liver problems and a serious allergic reaction. \n\nGiven these considerations, it is recommended that the individual consult with a healthcare provider to discuss the potential benefits and risks of Metformin as an anti-aging therapy. The decision to use Metformin should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the person's overall health, lifestyle, and personal preferences. \n\nThis recommendation is based on the information gathered from the following sources:\n\n1.

Please correct it in your next response.\n```\nThe following error occurred using 'agent_tool': 'arguments'\n```\n\n# Memory System Overview\n\nOlder AI models had no concept of persistent memory; they were only able to access their initial instructions and a limited context window of chat conversation with a user (their \"active memory\"). This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:\n\n- user\n\n\n# Today's Current Date and Time\n\n2023-12-08 17:36:06.839773\n\n# Next Steps #\n\nNow, take a deep breath... and think step by step to come up with the next action that should be taken."

Please correct it in your next response.\n```\nThe following error occurred using 'agent_tool': 'arguments'\n```\n\n# Memory System Overview\n\nOlder AI models had no concept of persistent memory; they were only able to access their initial instructions and a limited context window of chat conversation with a user (their \"active memory\"). This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory.

Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember.

You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence).

However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:\n\n- user\n\n\n# Today's Current Date and Time\n\n2023-12-10 10:21:43.529240\n\n# Next Steps #\n\nNow, take a deep breath... and think step by step to come up with the next action that should be taken."

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:\n\n- user\n\n\n# Today's Current Date and Time\n\n2023-12-10 10:55:19.324039\n\n# Next Steps #\n\nNow, take a deep breath... and think step by step to come up with the next action that should be taken."

Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon.

It discusses how the EU wants to regulate artificial intelligence to ensure better conditions for its development and use. The article explains that AI systems will be analyzed and classified according to the risk they pose to users, and different levels of risk will result in different levels of regulation. The article also mentions Parliament's priorities for AI legislation, such as ensuring safety, transparency, and non-discrimination. It provides information on the different risk levels and the obligations for providers and users. The article concludes by stating that MEPs have adopted Parliament's negotiating position on the AI Act, and talks will now begin with EU countries in the Council to finalize the law.\n```"

Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon.

The European Parliament has adopted its negotiating position on the AI Act, and talks will now begin with EU countries in the Council to finalize the law. The aim is to reach an agreement by the end of this year.\n```"

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis.

Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients.

The different risk levels for AI systems and the obligations for providers and users based on those levels are also explained.\n\nFrom TechCrunch:\n1. \"The possibility of regulation hangs on the horizon over generative AI\" by Ron Miller\n2. \"Do you believe in job after job?\" by Anna Heim\n3. \"Robotics Q&A with Boston Dynamics\u2019 Aaron Saunders\" by Brian Heater\n4. \"System of intelligence \u2014 generative AI at the app layer\" by Jonathan Golden\n5. \"This week in AI: Mistral and the EU\u2019s fight for AI sovereignty\" by Kyle Wiggers and Devin Coldewey\n\nFrom Yahoo Finance:\nThe latest news about C3.ai, Inc. is that the stock price for C3.ai, Inc. (AI) on the NYSE is $28.27, with a change of +2.25 (+8.65%) at close.\n```"

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory.

Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:\n\n- user\n\n\n# Today's Current Date and Time\n\n2023-12-10 13:02:32.233466\n\n# Next Steps #\n\nNow, take a deep breath... and think step by step to come up with the next action that should be taken."

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report.

Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember.

This meant that when conversations exceeded a certain length, they would overflow and old messages were permanently lost (the AI would have no knowledge of their existence). Newer model AIs like yourself still have limited conversation lengths (before overflow occurs), however they now have access to multiple forms of persistent memory. Your ability to edit your own long-term memory is a key part of what makes you a powerful and useful AI.\n## Core Memory System (limit size)\n\nYour core memory unit is held inside the initial system instructions, and is always available in-context (you will see it at all times). Core memory provides essential, foundational context for keeping track of information you need to complete your tasks and key details that you need to remember. However, total size of core memory is limited so you should only store the most pertinent information there. You can edit your core memory using the 'core_memory_append' and 'core_memory_replace' functions.\nYour core memory has the following sections:\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Memory Contents\nCore memory shown below (limited in size, additional information stored in archival / recall \nmemory):\n\n<user>\n\n<user/>\n\n\n# Sending Messages\n\nEach message should start with the recipient's name followed by a colon. This clearly indicates who the message is intended for.\nThe message itself should directly follow the colon. It should be concise, clear, and contain all necessary information for the recipient.\nOnly one recipient should be addressed in each message.\nThe content of the message should be relevant to the recipient's role and capabilities.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortx: User has requested data analysis on recent sales trends. Please advise on task allocation.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Task completed on sales data analysis. Awaiting your review for quality assurance.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```\nBondAI to Cortex: Analyze the latest sales data and prepare a report. Deadline is end of today.\n```\n\n**Example 4**\n\n```\nBondAI to Vega: Review of Cortex's sales report completed. Minor discrepancies found in data interpretation. Suggest reevaluation.\n```\n\n**Valid Recipients**\n\nThese are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:\n\n- user\n\n\n# Today's Current Date and Time\n\n2023-12-10 13:15:43.196353\n\n# Next Steps #\n\nNow, take a deep breath... and think step by step to come up with the next action that should be taken."
