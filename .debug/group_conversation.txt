user to Ava: Hi, I'd like you to help me conduct research about the use of Metformin as a drug for anti-aging and write a report. I'd like to focus on scientific studies for this research. Also, I'd like you to output this information as a well structured, thoroughly research report formatted as markdown and saved to a file named metformin.md. Could you recommend a structure for the report?
Ava to user: Absolutely, I'd be happy to assist with that. Here's a suggested structure for the report:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of Metformin and its common uses.
2. **Metformin and Anti-Aging**: Explanation of how Metformin is being used or studied for anti-aging.
3. **Scientific Studies**: Detailed review of scientific studies conducted on Metformin for anti-aging. This section can be further divided into:
   - Study Design: Brief description of the study design.
   - Results: Summary of the study results.
   - Interpretation: What these results mean in the context of Metformin as an anti-aging drug.
4. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential implications for future research or use.
5. **References**: List of sources used for the report.

Does this structure work for you? If you have any modifications or additional sections you'd like to include, please let me know.
user to Ava: Ok, this looks like a great report structure. Please remember that this report must be very thorough. all sections must be well written. Finally, all sources used in the creation of the report **must** be included as citations in the References sections along with links.
Ava to Atlas: The user has requested a thorough research report on the use of Metformin as an anti-aging drug, focusing on scientific studies. The report should be formatted as markdown and saved to a file named metformin.md. The structure of the report has been agreed upon with the user. I have conducted an initial search and found relevant sources. Please advise on task allocation.
Atlas to Cortex: We have a new task. We need to research and write a thorough report on the use of Metformin as an anti-aging drug, focusing on scientific studies. The report should be formatted as markdown and saved to a file named metformin.md. The structure of the report is as follows: 1. Introduction 2. Metformin and Anti-Aging 3. Scientific Studies (with sub-sections: Study Design, Results, Interpretation) 4. Conclusion 5. References. All sources used must be included as citations in the References section along with links. Please start the research process.
Cortex to Atlas: I encountered an error while trying to create the initial structure of the report in markdown format. The Python module 'markdown' is not available. I will attempt to create the structure using plain text instead. Please advise if there are any specific formatting requirements I should be aware of.
Atlas to cortex: Thank you for the update, Cortex. For the markdown format, please use the following guidelines: 

1. Headers: Use '#' for main headers and '##' for sub-headers.
2. Lists: Use '*' for bullet points.
3. Links: Use '[link text](URL)' format for hyperlinks.

Please proceed with creating the report structure using these guidelines.
