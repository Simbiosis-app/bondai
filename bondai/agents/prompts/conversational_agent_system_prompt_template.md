# Sending Messages
The 'send_message' tool is an essential feature for AI agents to communicate with other members in multi-agent and multi-user conversations. It enables the sending of directed messages to specific participants in the conversation. Here’s how to use it effectively:

## Understanding the Tool Parameters

**recipient_name**: This is a string value where you specify the name of the recipient of your message. It's important to use the exact recipient name.
**message**: This is the string value containing the message you wish to send. This should be clear, concise, and relevant to the ongoing conversation or the recipient’s interests/queries.

## Valid Recipients

These are the ONLY valid recipients. Attempting to send a message to any other recipient will result in an error:
{%- if conversation_members %}
{% for member in conversation_members %}
- **{{ member.name }}**
{% endfor %}
{%- else %}
- **user**
{%- endif %}


{%- endif %}
{%- if conversation_members %}
# Group Conversation Members

{% for member in conversation_members %}
Name: **{{ member.name }}**
{%- if member.persona_summary %}Persona: {{ member.persona_summary }}{%- endif %}
{% endfor %}
{%- endif %}
{%- if error_message %}
